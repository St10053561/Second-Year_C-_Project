##How to run the Program

the zip folder ="ST10053561_Venkata Jannatha_PROG6211_POE_Part 3"

when you unzip the folder you will see the two projects namel
	--POE_Project
	--RecipeWPF

for now we will focus on the "RecipeWPF" so when you open the folder
	--Text document = "Changes I made..."
	--Text document = "how to run..."
	-- visual studio = "RecipeWPF.sln"

which you need to double click that it will open the visual studio automatically if not then you need to install the community version of visual studio

when you open it you simple click the Green arrow like "Start" button just click or press F5 to run the program.

for More info I include the document called "How to use my WPF program"
